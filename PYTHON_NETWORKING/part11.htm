It details how these components are interconnected, the protocols they use to communicate, their IP address assignments, and their security settings. The configuration of a network is crucial to its performance, security, and reliability, and it often needs to be fine-tuned to meet the specific requirements of a business or application.</p><p>There are several types of network configurations, which depend on the network&#39;s size, purpose, and the physical and logical arrangement of its devices. For instance, in a star configuration, all devices connect to a central hub. In a bus configuration, all devices share a common communication line. In a ring configuration, each device connects to exactly two other devices, forming a loop. And in a mesh configuration, devices are interconnected, with multiple paths between any two nodes.</p><p>Network configurations can also be categorized based on the protocols they use. For instance, TCP/IP networks, the most common type of network today, are configured with IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS servers. Other network types include IPX/SPX networks (used primarily in systems that implement the Novell NetWare protocol suite) and AppleTalk networks (used in older Apple devices).</p><p>Network Configuration Management is the process of organizing and maintaining information about all the components of a network. It involves the collection and management of configuration data to ensure network resources are correctly configured and that the network is operating at optimal performance and reliability. It is a critical aspect of network administration, involving the tracking of individual devices, software, and other network components, ensuring they are properly set up, and monitoring their status over time.</p><p><a>Benefit of Network Configuration Management</a></p><p>The benefits of Network Configuration Management include improved network security (by ensuring that security settings are correctly configured and updated), reduced downtime (by quickly identifying and correcting configuration errors that can cause network failures), and improved operational efficiency (by automating routine configuration tasks, freeing up network administrators to focus on other tasks). Network Configuration Management also provides a record of changes made to the network configuration, which can be crucial for troubleshooting problems and for compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>Network Configuration Management can be a complex task, especially for large networks with many devices. Fortunately, several Python libraries, such as NAPALM and Netmiko, can help automate many aspects of network configuration and management. These tools provide an interface for sending configuration commands to network devices, retrieving their current configuration, and comparing configurations over time. This can significantly simplify the task of Network Configuration Management, making the network more reliable and easier to</p><p>maintain.</p><h2><a>NAPALM Library</a></h2><p><a>What is NAPALM?</a></p><p>NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) is a Python library that provides a unified API to different networking devices. It was designed to simplify and abstract some of the complexities of working with different network device interfaces. The name NAPALM signifies its purpose: a tool that allows network engineers to drop &#39;fire&#39; onto their networks and watch them melt into a consistent, programmable interface.</p><p>The primary features of NAPALM include:</p><p>●   Multi-vendor support: NAPALM supports a wide range of networking devices from different vendors, including Arista, Cisco, Juniper, and others.</p><p>●   Consistent API: Regardless of the underlying device type or operating system, the API remains consistent.</p><p>●  Configurations management: With NAPALM, you can retrieve the current configuration, replace or merge it, and rollback configurations if needed.</p><p>●  Operational state data: NAPALM allows you to fetch operational state data such as ARP tables, BGP neighbors, MAC tables, and others.</p><p><a>Installing NAPALM</a></p><p>To install NAPALM, you can use pip:</p><p><br/></p><p>pip install napalm</p><p>pip install napalm</p><p/><p>pip install napalm</p><p>Once NAPALM is installed, you can start using it to interact with your network devices. Below is a simple program of how you might use NAPALM to connect to a device and retrieve some information:</p><p><br/></p><p>import napalm</p><p># Create a driver for the device type (e.g., &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;junos&#39;, &#39;eos&#39;, etc.) driver = napalm.get_network_driver(&#39;ios&#39;)</p><p># Create a connection to the device</p><p>device = driver(hostname=&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, username=&#39;admin&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;)</p><p># Open the connection</p><p>import napalm</p><p># Create a driver for the device type (e.g., &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;junos&#39;, &#39;eos&#39;, etc.) driver = napalm.get_network_driver(&#39;ios&#39;)</p><p># Create a connection to the device</p><p>device = driver(hostname=&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, username=&#39;admin&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;)</p><p># Open the connection</p><p/><p>import napalm</p><p># Create a driver for the device type (e.g., &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;junos&#39;, &#39;eos&#39;, etc.) driver = napalm.get_network_driver(&#39;ios&#39;)</p><p># Create a connection to the device</p><p>device = driver(hostname=&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, username=&#39;admin&#39;, password=&#39;password&#39;)</p><p># Open the connection</p><p>device.open()</p><p># Get facts about the device facts = device.get_facts()</p><p># Print the facts</p><p>for key, value in facts.items(): print(f&quot;{key}: {value}&quot;)</p><p># Close the connection</p><p>device.close()</p><p>device.open()</p><p># Get facts about the device facts = device.get_facts()</p><p># Print the facts</p><p>for key, value in facts.items(): print(f&quot;{key}: {value}&quot;)</p><p># Close the connection</p><p>device.close()</p><p/><p>device.open()</p><p># Get facts about the device facts = device.get_facts()</p><p># Print the facts</p><p>for key, value in facts.items(): print(f&quot;{key}: {value}&quot;)</p><p># Close the connection</p><p>device.close()</p><p>In the above program, get_facts() retrieves some basic information about the device, such as the model, serial number, uptime, etc. NAPALM provides many other methods for interacting with the device, such as get_interfaces(), get_bgp_neighbors(), and get_config(). Please note that you should replace &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, and &#39;password&#39; with the actual driver type, device IP, username, and password of the network device you&#39;re trying to connect to. And, always remember to close the connection when you&#39;re done. This releases resources on both your machine and the network device.</p><h2><a>Version  Control  and  Network  Configuration Backup</a></h2><p>Version control and backup of network configurations are essential for managing network infrastructures. By using version control systems such as Git, we can track changes over time, identify who made a change, and roll back changes if an issue arises.</p><p>NAPALM, as mentioned before, is a Python library that simplifies the process of interacting with network devices. While it doesn&#39;t directly integrate with version control systems, we can combine it with tools such as Git to manage network configurations effectively.</p><p>The following steps provide an example of how you might use NAPALM to retrieve network configurations and store them in a Git repository.</p><p><a>Install Necessary Libraries</a></p><p>Install the NAPALM and GitPython libraries, which provide the functionality we need to interact with network devices and Git repositories, respectively.</p><p><br/></p><p>pip install napalm gitpython</p><p>pip install napalm gitpython</p><p/><p>pip install napalm gitpython</p><p><br/></p><p><a>Retrieve the Network Configuration</a></p><p>We use NAPALM to connect to the network device and retrieve the current configuration.</p><p><br/></p><p>import napalm</p><p>def get_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>config = get_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p>import napalm</p><p>def get_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>config = get_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p/><p>import napalm</p><p>def get_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>config = get_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p>In this code, we define a function get_config that uses NAPALM to retrieve the configuration of a network device. The with statement ensures that the connection to the device is closed after we retrieve the configuration.</p><p><a>Store Configuration in Git</a></p><p>Next, we use GitPython to store the retrieved configuration in a Git repository.</p><p><br/></p><p>from        git        import        Repo                       </p><p>def save_config_to_git(config, repo_path, commit_message): repo = Repo(repo_path)</p><p>with open(f&quot;{repo_path}/config.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) as f: f.write(config)</p><p>repo.git.add(&#39;--all&#39;)</p><p>repo.git.commit(&#39;-m&#39;, commit_message) save_config_to_git(config, &#39;/path/to/your/repo&#39;, &#39;Add initial config&#39;)</p><p>def save_config_to_git(config, repo_path, commit_message): repo = Repo(repo_path)</p><p>with open(f&quot;{repo_path}/config.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) as f: f.write(config)</p><p>repo.git.add(&#39;--all&#39;)</p><p>repo.git.commit(&#39;-m&#39;, commit_message) save_config_to_git(config, &#39;/path/to/your/repo&#39;, &#39;Add initial config&#39;)</p><p/><p>def save_config_to_git(config, repo_path, commit_message): repo = Repo(repo_path)</p><p>with open(f&quot;{repo_path}/config.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) as f: f.write(config)</p><p>repo.git.add(&#39;--all&#39;)</p><p>repo.git.commit(&#39;-m&#39;, commit_message) save_config_to_git(config, &#39;/path/to/your/repo&#39;, &#39;Add initial config&#39;)</p><p>This function save_config_to_git takes the configuration, a path to a Git repository, and a commit message. It writes the configuration to a file in the repository, then adds the file to the staging area and commits it.</p><p>After performing all the above steps, you now have a version-controlled backup of your network configuration. If the configuration of the network device changes, you can retrieve the new configuration and commit it to the Git repository. You can also push your changes to a remote repository to have an off-site backup.</p><p>And, do not forget to replace &#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;, and &#39;/path/to/your/repo&#39; with your actual device IP, username, password, driver type, and path to your Git repository.</p><h2><a>Automating Network Configuration</a></h2><p>Automating network configuration changes can be a significant advantage in maintaining a network as it reduces human error and increases efficiency. We will continue to use the NAPALM library for this.</p><p>Before proceeding, keep in mind that any changes to network configurations should be done carefully, as incorrect settings can lead to network disruptions.</p><p>Let us see how we can automate network configuration changes using NAPALM:</p><p><a>Load the New Configuration</a></p><p>Let us assume you have a configuration file called new_config.txt with the configuration changes you want to apply. You can load this configuration into the network device using the load_merge_candidate method, which merges the current configuration with the new one.</p><p><br/></p><p>import napalm</p><p>def load_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name, config_file):</p><p>driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name) with driver(hostname, username, password) as device:</p><p>device.load_merge_candidate(filename=config_file)</p><p>load_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;new_config.txt&#39;)</p><p>import napalm</p><p>def load_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name, config_file):</p><p>driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name) with driver(hostname, username, password) as device:</p><p>device.load_merge_candidate(filename=config_file)</p><p>load_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;new_config.txt&#39;)</p><p/><p>import napalm</p><p>def load_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name, config_file):</p><p>driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name) with driver(hostname, username, password) as device:</p><p>device.load_merge_candidate(filename=config_file)</p><p>load_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;, &#39;new_config.txt&#39;)</p><p><br/></p><p>This function opens a connection to the network device, loads the new configuration, and merges it with the existing one.</p><p><a>Commit the Changes</a></p><p>After loading the new configuration, you need to commit the changes for them to take effect. If you&#39;re satisfied with the changes, you can commit them using the commit_config method.</p><p><br/></p><p>def commit_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: device.commit_config()</p><p>commit_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p>def commit_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: device.commit_config()</p><p>commit_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p/><p>def commit_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: device.commit_config()</p><p>commit_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;)</p><p>This function commits any pending configuration changes on the network device.</p><p><a>Verify the Changes</a></p><p>After committing the changes, you should verify that they have been applied correctly. You can do this by retrieving the current configuration and checking that it contains the expected settings.</p><p><br/></p><p>def verify_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>print(verify_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;))</p><p>def verify_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>print(verify_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;))</p><p/><p>def verify_config(hostname, username, password, driver_name): driver = napalm.get_network_driver(driver_name)</p><p>with driver(hostname, username, password) as device: return device.get_config()</p><p>print(verify_config(&#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;))</p><p><br/></p><p>This function retrieves and prints the current configuration of the network device.</p><p>Again, do not forget to replace &#39;10.0.0.1&#39;, &#39;admin&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;ios&#39;, and &#39;new_config.txt&#39; with your actual device IP, username, password, driver type, and path to your configuration file.</p><h2><a>Summary</a></h2><p>In this chapter, we delved into Network Configuration Management and its importance in maintaining robust and efficient networks. We learned that network configurations are the detailed settings related to the operational parameters of network devices. These configurations, if not managed correctly, can lead to system vulnerabilities, inconsistencies, and network failures. We also explored the different types of network configurations, such as initial configurations,  functional  configurations,  and  performance  configurations.  Network Configuration Management, a crucial aspect of network management, ensures the network&#39;s optimal performance by maintaining, updating, and backing up these configurations.</p><p>We then explored the NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) library, a Python library that standardizes how we interact with different network devices. We learned how to install and use NAPALM to connect to network devices, retrieve their configurations, and even change the configurations. NAPALM&#39;s ability to support multiple vendors and platforms makes it a versatile tool for network configuration management.</p><p>Finally, we examined how to automate network configuration changes using NAPALM, which can significantly reduce manual errors and increase efficiency. We learned to load new configurations onto a network device, commit these changes, and verify the changes. This automation process allows network administrators to manage complex network configurations more efficiently. We also discussed the importance of version control and backup in preserving network configurations, ensuring the network&#39;s stability and minimizing potential disruptions due to misconfigurations.</p><p><br/></p><p><a href="part10.htm">&lt; Назад</a> | <a href="index.html">Содержимое</a> | <a href="part12.htm">Далее &gt;</a></p></body></html>
